## 🚗 Voice-Controlled Car using Speech Recognition and Python

This project demonstrates a voice-controlled car system using Python and speech recognition libraries. It allows users to control the movement of a simulated or real car by giving voice commands.

---

### 📌 Features
- Real-time voice recognition and processing
- Command mapping for directional movement (e.g., forward, backward, stop)
- Audio input handling using microphones
- Basic error handling for unrecognized commands

---

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- SpeechRecognition
- PyAudio
- Jupyter Notebook
- (Optional) Arduino / Hardware integration

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install SpeechRecognition pyaudio
   ```
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter or Colab
3. Run each cell and speak commands like “forward”, “stop”, or “left” into your mic.
